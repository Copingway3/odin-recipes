<h1>Smashburger</h1>
<img src="./smashburger.jpg">
<p>A burger that has been made by <strong>smashing</strong> ground meat onto a griddle with a spatula. The goal is to <em>caramelize</em> the meat </p>
<p> and <em>lock</em> in the juices while the browning on the outside is crispy and full of flavour. This recipe is for 4 burgers.</p>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<uo>
    <li>4 burger buns</li>
    <li>450 grams (1 pound) of ground meat (preferably 80/20 lean to fat ratio)</li>
    <li>4 slices of American cheese</li>
    <li>4 15 cm (6 inch) squares of Parchment paper</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Any toppings and condiments of choice</li>
</uo>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat a grill and add oil. When you see the oil smoking, the grill is ready. It is recommended that you grill these outside as smash burgers will create a lot of smoke.</li>
    <li>Lightly toast your buns on the grill and then set them aside</li>
    <li>Form the ground meat into 8 roughly 55 gram (2 ounce) balls. Pack these lightly to smash the meat on the grill properly. Start placing the meat on the grill with a piece of parchment paper on top (this is to prevent sticking) and using a <strong>metal</strong> spatula, start smashing until the meat is thin. Salt the meat now.</li>
    <li>You will want to grill the meat for approximately 45 seconds or until you see the edges are dark brown. Using the metal spatula, you will want to scrape up the meat and flip them. Cover with American cheese and grill for another 20 seconds. Now stack the patties without cheese on-top of the patties with cheese. Place the cooked patties onto a grilled bun and serve with toppings if you so choose.</li>
